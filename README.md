# Information
Use full length alphanumeric characters.  The file will not repack properly if you do not.  There is no way around this (without editing the eboot.bin of the game).
This is my first python tool so expect pretty bad coding if you want to read it.
Includes an edited version of SutandoTsukai181's [PyBinaryReader](https://github.com/SutandoTsukai181/PyBinaryReader).

# Warning
Once the exe has been created, it may come up as malware by windows defender. I assure you it's not, but if you don't trust it then feel free to use the source code.
